# FormulaAI
A racing game intended for studying machine learning. Implemented in Python.

Currently included machine learning algorithms:
* A feedforward neural network with online learning
* A feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent learning
* Reinforcement learning (Q learning)

Can be played on keyboard, but an autopilot is also implemented. :)
